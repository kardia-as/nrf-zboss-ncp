# nRF ZBOSS NCP

This repository contains compiled ZBOSS NCP firmware images for Nordic Semiconductor with nRF52840 (nRF52 series) SoC, for use with example the [nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dongle), as well as nRF5340 (nRF53 series) SoC, for use with the [nRF5340-DK development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf5340-dk).

Compared to Nordic Semi's default NCP sample this image has been configured to use maximum memory.

This is a prebuilt hex image of Nordic Semi's NCP sample (a ZBOSS-based firmware image for running the nRF SoC side of the [Network Co-Processor design](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/2.4.1/nrf/protocols/zigbee/architectures.html#network-co-processor-ncp)) that has been tested with [zigpy-zboss](https://github.com/kardia-as/zigpy-zboss) (a ZBOSS radio library for [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/)).

You can flash the device with this firmware image using for example the programmer application from the [nRF Desktop application](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-connect-for-desktop).
